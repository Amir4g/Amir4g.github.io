## Overview

This project focuses on developing advanced computer vision systems for ice hockey broadcast video analysis. The system provides real-time insights into player movements, game events, and performance metrics.

## Key Features

- **Homography Estimation**: Rink-agnostic analysis for different hockey arenas
- **Puck Detection**: Real-time tracking of puck movement and position
- **Player Action Recognition**: Identification of player actions and behaviors
- **Game Event Detection**: Automatic detection of goals, penalties, and other game events

## Technical Approach

The system utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques including:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction
- Temporal modeling for action recognition
- Multi-object tracking for player and puck detection
- Geometric transformations for homography estimation

## Collaborations

- **Stathletes Inc**: Industry partner for broadcast video analysis
- **University of Waterloo**: Academic research collaboration
- **Sport Analytics Research Group**: Multi-disciplinary research team
