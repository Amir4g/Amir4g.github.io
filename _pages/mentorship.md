## Mentorship Philosophy

I believe in fostering a collaborative learning environment where students can develop both technical skills and research independence. My mentorship approach focuses on:

- **Hands-on Research Experience**: Direct involvement in cutting-edge computer vision and AI projects
- **Academic Growth**: Supporting students in developing research skills, writing papers, and presenting at conferences
- **Career Development**: Guidance on academic and industry career paths in AI and computer vision
- **Project Management**: Teaching modern research methodologies including Kanban and agile approaches

## Current Mentorship Opportunities

### Graduate Research Assistants (2024-present)
I am currently co-mentoring **2 PhD and 6 master students** in the sports analytics research group at the University of Waterloo. Our collaborative work focuses on:

- **Ice Hockey Analytics**: Broadcast video analysis, player tracking, and game event detection
- **Computer Vision Systems**: Homography estimation, object detection, and action recognition
- **Machine Learning Applications**: Continual learning, neural networks, and deep learning models

### Undergraduate Research Opportunities

I regularly supervise undergraduate students in research projects. Current areas include:

- **Computer Vision Projects**: Image processing, object detection, and video analysis
- **Machine Learning Applications**: Neural networks, deep learning, and AI model development
- **Sports Analytics**: Data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling
- **Medical AI**: Ultrasound data analysis and medical image processing

## Mentorship Approach

### Research Methodology
- **Modern Project Management**: Utilizing tools like Jira and Kanban for academic research coordination
- **Iterative Development**: Encouraging rapid prototyping and continuous improvement
- **Collaborative Learning**: Regular group meetings, code reviews, and knowledge sharing sessions

### Skill Development Focus
- **Technical Skills**: Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, computer vision algorithms
- **Research Skills**: Literature review, experimental design, statistical analysis
- **Communication Skills**: Academic writing, presentation, and collaboration
- **Professional Development**: Conference submissions, networking, and career planning
