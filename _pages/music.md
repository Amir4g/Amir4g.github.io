## Musical Journey

Beyond my academic pursuits in computer vision and AI, music has been a constant source of inspiration and creative expression throughout my life.

## Musical Background

I am a tenor-in-training who enjoys singing in choirs.

- I have been a member of the [Del-o-Jaan Persian Choir](https://www.facebook.com/DelOJanChoir/) since 2019.
- I joined the University of Waterloo Choir in Winter 2024.

## Current Musical Projects

I am currently collaborating with [Navakavan](https://navakavan.com) as an AI researcher and developer.  
Together, we are building an intuitive AI-powered tool that enables aspiring musicians and singers to learn and compose music with real-time visual feedback.
